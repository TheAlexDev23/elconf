# elconf
CLI program that creates a png file representing an element's electronic configuration. A school project.

This program uses the following libraries made by me: [libpttui](https://github.com/TheAlexDev23/libpttui), [libperiodic-c](https://github.com/TheAlexDev23/libperiodic-c) and [libpel](https://github.com/TheAlexDev23/libpel)

This program uses the following open source libraries: [cwalk](https://github.com/likle/cwalk), [png](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

This program and all the libraries it uses made by me are licensed under GPL3

## How it works
